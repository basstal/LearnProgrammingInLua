# Interlude-The Eight Queen Puzzle #

## Exercise 2.1 ##

Modify the eight-queen program so that it stops after printing the first solution.

## Exercise 2.2 ##

An alternative implementation for the eight-queen problem would be to generate all possible permutations of 1 to 8 and, for each permutation, to check whether it is valid. Change the program to use this approach. How does the performance of the new program compare with the old one? (Hint: compare the total number of permutations with the number of times that the original program calls the function isplaceok.)
