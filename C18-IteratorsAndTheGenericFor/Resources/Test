To do this traversal, we keep two values: the contents of the current line (variable line), and where we
are on this line (variable pos). With this data, we can always generate the next word. The main part of the
iterator function is the call to string.match, which searches for a word in the current line starting at the
current position. It describes a “word” using the pattern '%w+', which matches one or more alphanumeric
characters. If it finds a word, it captures and returns the word and the position of the first character after it
(with an empty capture). The function then updates the current position and returns this word. Otherwise,
the iterator reads a new line and repeats the search. If there are no more lines, it returns nil to signal the
end of the iteration.
