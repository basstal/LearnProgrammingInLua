## Exercise 25.1 ##

Adapt getvarvalue (Figure 25.1, “Getting the value of a variable”) to work with different coroutines (like the functions from the debug library).

## Exercise 25.2 ##

Write a function setvarvalue similar to getvarvalue (Figure 25.1, “Getting the value of a variable”).

[Setvarvalue.lua](./Resources/Setvarvalue.lua)

## Exercise 25.3 ##

Write a version of getvarvalue (Figure 25.1, “Getting the value of a variable”) that returns a table with all variables that are visible at the calling function. (The returned table should not include environmental variables; instead, it should inherit them from the original environment.)
